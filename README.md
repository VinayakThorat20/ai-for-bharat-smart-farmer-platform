## 🌍 The Problem

Indian farmers lose **30–40% income every season** due to:

- Generic advisories that ignore village-level realities  
- Middlemen-dominated markets  
- Poor price discovery  
- Inaccessible digital tools  
- Underutilized government schemes  

> **KisanAI Setu is a farmer-first, public-impact digital utility — not a commission-driven marketplace.**

---

## 🎯 Alignment with AI for Communities, Access & Public Impact

KisanAI Setu directly improves:

✔ Access to localized agronomy intelligence  
✔ Access to fair market opportunities  
✔ Access to government schemes  
✔ Access to AI in local languages & voice  
✔ Access for low-literacy & low-bandwidth rural communities  

Designed for **86% small & marginal farmers across Bharat.**

---

## 🚨 Ground Reality

- Generic crop advisories ignore micro-climate & soil conditions  
- No reliable village-level price trend intelligence  
- Excessive chemical usage degrading soil health  
- Farmers lose margins to intermediaries  
- Language & literacy barriers restrict digital adoption  
- Schemes often fail to reach eligible farmers  

**Outcome today:**  
Low profit • High risk • Poor technology adoption

## ❌ Why Existing Solutions Fail

| Gap in Ecosystem | Current Tools |
|------------------|--------------|
| Data granularity | District/state averages |
| AI transparency | Opaque predictions |
| Language access | English-heavy apps |
| Market structure | Broker-dominated |
| Decision scope | Isolated advisory tips |

> 👉 No single platform combines **hyper-local AI + direct market access + inclusive access design.**
