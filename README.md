# AI for Bharat – Farmer Decision Support & Market Access Platform

## 🚜 Problem Statement
Indian farmers face major challenges due to lack of localized data, dependence on middlemen, limited access to market price intelligence, and low awareness of government schemes. Most existing solutions are generic, language-limited, and do not work effectively at the village level.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
We propose an **AI-powered, location-specific decision support platform** that empowers farmers to:

- Make informed crop decisions based on **local soil, rainfall, and historical data**
- **Sell crops directly to companies and consumers**, eliminating brokers and middlemen
- Receive **AI-based recommendations** for organic and minimal chemical inputs
- Access **government schemes and subsidies** personalized to their profile
- Use the platform in **local Indian languages with voice support**

---

## 🧠 Role of AI
AI is the core of our solution and is used to:

- Analyze historical crop performance at **village/district level**
- Predict **optimal sowing time and harvest window**
- Forecast **market price trends with uncertainty indicators**
- Recommend **fertilizers and inputs** based on soil health and past outcomes
- Match farmers with buyers using **geographic proximity and demand patterns**

All AI outputs are **decision-support insights**, not guaranteed predictions, ensuring responsible AI usage.
