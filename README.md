## 🚩 Problem Statement

Indian farmers lose **30–40% seasonal income** due to:

- Generic, non-localized advisories  
- Middlemen-dominated price discovery  
- No short-term price intelligence  
- Excessive chemical dependency  
- Poor access to eligible government schemes  
- Language & literacy barriers in digital platforms  

📌 **86% of Indian farmers are small & marginal (60M+ farmers)**  
📌 Most current agri-tech tools are state-level, English-heavy, and not explainable  

**Outcome today:** Low profit • High risk • Limited AI adoption
